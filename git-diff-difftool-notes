To see what's changed between two commits:

# git difftool 8ac97f6f2e 6476dd1c88

The committed file "unborn-branch" had this text as it's content:
"Do you know what an unborn branch is in Git jargon?"
I added "That's it." to its bottom. And staged this file with "git add".
I then added "Done" to it's bottom, but left it un-staged.
Now, you see the "git diff", vs "git diff --staged/--cached" vs "git difftool".

C:\Users\ryarrapu\Git-ProGit>git difftool --tool-help
'git difftool --tool=<tool>' may be set to one of the following:
                vimdiff          Use Vim
                winmerge         Use WinMerge (requires a graphical session)

The following tools are valid, but not currently available:
                araxis           Use Araxis Merge (requires a graphical session)
                bc               Use Beyond Compare (requires a graphical session)
                bc3              Use Beyond Compare (requires a graphical session)



Default difftool is vimdiff. 
You can set 'winmerge' (if installed and it is in system path), as difftool as below:
# git config --replace --global diff.tool winmerge
# git config --replace --global difftool.prompt false

How these 3 commands are different?
# git difftool
# git difftool --cached
# git difftool --staged
